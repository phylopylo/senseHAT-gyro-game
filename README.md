# SenseHAT Gyroscope Game
A game written in Python + PyGame for the Raspberry Pi 4 and senseHAT. Control a character with the embedded gyroscope in the senseHAT. Created for a digital electronics class during Junior year of high school.

For the button and LED functionality to work, there has to be a spacer in between the GPIO pins on the pi and the senseHAT for the breadboard to connect into.
